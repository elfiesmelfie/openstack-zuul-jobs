    # All emit-job-header does is a debug statement so the worst that would
    # happen would be that the debug task would fail outright and we'd prevent
    # something breaking that debug statement from merging just by running it.
    # However, the emit-job-header role includes the set-zuul-log-path-fact
    # role. We can only test for zuul_log_path against changes, though.
